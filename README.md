# Image Captioning Project

This repository contains my implementation of an image captioning model. The model takes an image as input and generates a descriptive English caption.

## Project Overview

- Developed a deep learning model that combines computer vision and natural language processing
- Implemented from scratch using PyTorch
- Explored various architectures including CNNs for image feature extraction and RNNs/Transformers for caption generation

## Results

This model achieved a maximum BLEU-4 caption score of 11.0

## Future Work

- Improve caption accuracy and fluency
- Experiment with more advanced architectures
- Expand the dataset for better generalization
